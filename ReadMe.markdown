# **Documentation**

Take a look at the PDF inside the download package to get detailed information on features and configuration setup

# **Things to Consider**

- The Implant generated by the Controller **communicates with the Controller over TCP**
- The **Controller generates only binary payload** and generation of EXE and DLL is not supported

# **Note**

The project is in development and will include more features in the upcoming releases.
